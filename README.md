# MSIV Dataset: Multi-Scenary Infrared and Visible Image Dataset

The **MSIV** dataset is a newly proposed benchmark designed for training and evaluating infrared and visible image fusion algorithms. It contains diverse, real-world scenes captured under various environmental conditions and with multiple types of thermal targets.

> ðŸ“„ Used in the paper: [DSFuse: A Dual-Diffusion Structure for Feature Fidelity Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074762), accepted by IEEE TNNLS 2025.

## ðŸŒŸ Highlights

- âœ… 7000 finely aligned infrared-visible image pairs
- âœ… Multiple target types: people, cars, ships, UAVs, camouflaged objects
- âœ… Various scenes: urban streets, natural landscapes, lakes, buildings
- âœ… Diverse conditions: daytime, nighttime, rainy weather
- âœ… High-quality annotations for detection/segmentation tasks (optional)

## ðŸ§ª Recommended Use

- Image Fusion: IR-VI image fusion for general-purpose or target-aware scenarios
- Detection: Use fused or single-modality images for object detection
- Segmentation: Segment objects under challenging conditions

Recommended preprocessing:

- Resize to 640Ã—480 or crop to 360Ã—360
- Normalize to [0, 1] range
- Align images using homography if necessary (already applied in this dataset)

## ðŸ“Š Related Benchmark Results

The MSIV dataset was used in the DSFuse paper to train and evaluate fusion models, showing strong generalization ability and significant performance gains across fusion, detection, and segmentation tasks.
